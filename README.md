floating-pointless
------------------

Software floating-point operations in Rust.

### Why do this?

Since pretty much every compouter that exists nowadays has a floating-point co-processor, you're probably wondering: isn't this library completely pointless? The answer is "yes". This library is (as the name implies) nearly 100% useless.

So why do this? Firstly, because I want to learn more about how floating-point works, and secondly, because I have a severely twisted concept of "fun".
